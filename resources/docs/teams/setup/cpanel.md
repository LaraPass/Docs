## Sign Up

If you don't already have one, you can sign-up for a cheaper cPanel Shared Hosting from <a href="https://refs.spargon.tech/a2-hosting" target="_blank">**`A2Hosting`**</a>

> {info} LaraPass v2 will work perfectly on a Shared Hosting server, however if your hosting, provider has certain limitations on permissions or forces public_html directory for all, then the Auto-Updater may not be able to perform, as such, we recommend using a VPS instead of Shared Hosting.

## Setting up cPanel

Login to your cPanel Host account (usually available at the url address **``yourdomain.com:2082``** ).  
<br>

`+` **`Step # 1`** - Navigate to the **``Domains``**, **``Addon Domains``** or **``Sub-domains``** (depending on which type of domain you want to use. For this example we will be using a sub-domain, so click on the Sub-Domains Page in your cPanel (the proceedure is almost same for all types of domains).  

---

`+` **`Step # 2`** - Pick a new subdomain, in our case we will be testing with ``demo``

---

`+` **`Step # 3`** - Select a domain, in our case its `larapass.net`, so the full url of our demo app will be `demo.larapass.net`  
<br>

`+` **`Step # 4`** - Ensure that the **Document Root** is pointing towards **<i class="fas fa-home"></i>/larapass/public** directory and under **Redirect** it says `not redirected`.   
<br>

---

`+` **`Step # 5`** - Open File Manager in cPanel or login to your server using an FTP program such as FileZilla or CyberDuck. Navigate to the **root** directory. Create a new folder with the name `larapass` if it doesn't already exists. If it already exists, then open it and delete all the files inside.  
<br>

## Create Database

Before you can proceed with the installation, you need to create a MySQL Database. To do this, 

`+` **`Step # 1`** - Open your cPanel. Open **MySQLÂ® Databases** under **Databases**.  

---

`+` **`Step # 2`** - Create a new database with a name of your choice.  
<br>

<br>
