## Outgoing Mailer

LaraPass v2 sends allot of transactional emails for a variety of reasons such as - email verification, team invites, new device login, password reset, account information, limit notifications, personal data requests, etc., as such an outgoing mailer needs to be setup and configured. If you don't setup one, several critical functions of LaraPas v2 won't work (during testing/development you can set the mailer as `log` and all outgoing mails will be stored in `/storage/logs/laravel.log` file).  

> {primary} Detailed instructions on how to setup your mailer can be found [`here`](../admin/email-settings)

## Cron Job

LaraPass v2 uses scheduled tasks to automatically execute certain actions such as clearing logs, taking database backups, deleting marked accounts, etc. As such, you need to enabled/setup a cron job to run on your server. 
<br>  
In order to setup cron job, navigate to the cron jobs page on your hosting panel, select the interval at which the cron jobs should run at (ideally you should set every minute or every 5 minutes), and then add the following command (along with the directory of larapass on your server) -

**`Cron jon command on Cloudways`**
```php
* * * * * php /home/master/applications/app_root_name/public_html/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```
<small>Replace **'app_root_name'** with the random text/name generated by cloudways for your app.</small>
