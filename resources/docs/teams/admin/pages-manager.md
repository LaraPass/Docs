## Publish Page

If you are not yet ready to publish a page (still writing content of it), then you can set the status of your page to **`Draft`**. Pages in draft status will only be visible to admins, regular users or visitors will get a 404-page not found error on accessing it. Once you are satisfied with the content, you can change the status to **`Published`** by editing the page. Once published, the page will be visible to all.
