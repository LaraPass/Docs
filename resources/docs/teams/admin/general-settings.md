<a name="logo"></a>
## App Logo

You can upload your App Logo & favicon from here. Be sure to upload a darker and lighter version of your logo.

---

<a name="theme"></a>
## Themes

You can select from any of the available themes here. The theme will be applied site wide. 

`Currently we only have a default theme available. More themes will be added soon.`

---

<a name="locale"></a>
## Language & Locale

You can select a default locale / language from which will be applied site wide to all your users / visitors.  
<br/>
If you don't find your desired language in the list and would like to help us expedite the transaltions for it, head over to our [**Translations**](https://github.com/LaraPass/Translations) repo and open a PR for it. All contributions will be credited appropriately.  
<br/>
You can also enable `Allow User Locale` which will give your users the ability to switch between different locales regardless of your app's default locale.

---

<a name="copyright"></a>
## Footer Copyright

You can display whatever copyright text you want to. The field accepts basic HTML styling and tooling - as such you can also add links in the footer using the `<a href="">` tag.

---

<a name="force-https"></a>
## Force HTTPS

You can **`Enable`** App Level HTTPS Redirection by setting the **Force HTTPS** option to **Yes**. This will redirect all unsecured http urls to secured https urls.

> {warning} We highly recommend using your web servers (Apache / NGINX) config file or the .htaccess file to setup and enable force https redirection instead of using this app-level redirection.
